This application was developed as the final practice of Artificial Intelligence, an Information Systems Engineering fifth level subject. The idea was to design a system of colaborative agents that represents every stakeholder involved in the purchase of a turism package:
 * Travel agencies;
 * Transports, airlines or buses;
 * Hotels.
Once the customer sets his preferences, all the agents work together and negotiate to get the best package available.
